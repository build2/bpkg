    "\h|SYNOPSIS|

     \c{\b{bpkg rep-info} [<options>] <rep-loc>}

     \h|DESCRIPTION|

     The \cb{rep-info} command prints various information about the specified
     repository. By default it print the repository's name and location as the
     first line. If the repository is signed, the certificate information
     (name/organization/email) is printed as the next line followed by the
     certificate fingerprint. Then comes the list of complement and
     prerequisite repositories followed by the list of available packages.

     This default format can be altered in various ways using options listed
     below. Note also that the information is written to \cb{stdout}, not
     \cb{stderr}.

     If the current working directory contains a \cb{bpkg} configuration, then
     \cb{rep-info} will use its certificate database for the repository
     authentication. That is, it will trust the repository's certificate if it
     is already trusted by the configuration. Otherwise it will add the
     certificate to the configuration if you confirm it is trusted. You can
     specify an alternative configuration directory with the
     \cb{--directory|-d} option. To disable using the configuration in the
     current working directory pass this option with an empty path."

   \h|DEFAULT OPTIONS FILES|

   See \l{bpkg-default-options-files(1)} for an overview of the default
   options files. If the \cb{rep-info} command uses an existing \c{bpkg}
   configuration, then the start directory is the configuration directory.
   Otherwise, only the predefined directories (home, system, etc) are
   searched. The following options files are searched for in each directory
   and, if found, loaded in the order listed:

   \
   bpkg.options
   bpkg-rep-info.options
   \

   The following \cb{rep-info} command options cannot be specified in the
   default options files:

   \
   --directory|-d
   \
  "
