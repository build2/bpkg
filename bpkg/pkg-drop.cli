     \c{\b{bpkg pkg-drop}|\b{drop} [<options>] <pkg>...}

     \h|DESCRIPTION|

     The \cb{pkg-drop} command drops one or more packages from the
     configuration. If the packages being dropped still have dependent
     packages, then those will have to be dropped as well and you will be
     prompted to confirm. And if the packages being dropped have dependency
     packages that would otherwise no longer be used, then they will be
     dropped as well unless the \c{\b{--keep-unused}|\b{-K}} option is
     specified.

     The \cb{pkg-drop} command also supports several options (described below)
     that allow you to control the amount of work that will be done."
