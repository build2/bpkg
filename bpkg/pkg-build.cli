    "\h|SYNOPSIS|

     \c{\b{bpkg pkg-build} [<options>] (<pkg>[/<ver>] | <file> | <dir>)...}

     \h|DESCRIPTION|

     The \cb{pkg-build} command builds one or more packages including all their
     prerequisites. Each package can be specified as just the name (<pkg>) with
     optional package version (<ver>) in which case the package will be
     automatically fetched from one of the configuration's source repositories
     (see the \cb{cfg-add} and \cb{cfg-fetch} commands). Alternatively, the
     package can be specified as either the path to the package source archive
     (<file>) or package source directory (<dir>). See the \cb{pkg-fetch} and
     \cb{pkg-unpack} commands for more information on the semantics of
     specifying the package as an archive or directory.

     Packages that are specified explicitly on the command line will be
     \i{held}, that is, they will not be considered for automatic removal if
     they no longer have any dependents. Packages that are specified with the
     explicit package version (<ver>) or as an archive or directory, will, in
     addition, have their versions held, that is, they will not be
     automatically upgraded.

     The \cb{pkg-build} command also supports several \cb{--*-only} options
     that allow you to limit the amount of work that will be done."
