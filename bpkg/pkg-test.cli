     \c{\b{bpkg pkg-test}|\b{test} [<options>] [<vars>] <pkg>...\n
        \b{bpkg pkg-test}|\b{test} [<options>] [<vars>] \b{--all}|\b{-a}}

     \h|DESCRIPTION|

     The \cb{pkg-test} command tests the specified packages (the first form)
     or all the held packages (the second form, see \l{bpkg-pkg-status(1)}).
     Additionally, immediate or all dependencies of these packages can also be
     tested by specifying the \c{\b{--immediate}|\b{-i}} or
     \c{\b{--recursive}|\b{-r}} options, respectively. Underneath, this
     command doesn't do much more than run \cb{b test}. In the first form the
     specified packages must have been previously configured with
     \l{bpkg-pkg-build(1)} or \l{bpkg-pkg-configure(1)}.

     Additional command line variables (<vars>, normally \cb{config.*}) can be
     passed to the build system. Such variables apply to all the specified
     packages but can also be specified to only apply to specific packages
     using the argument grouping mechanism (see \l{bpkg-argument-grouping(1)}
     for details)."

   \h|DEFAULT OPTIONS FILES|

   See \l{bpkg-default-options-files(1)} for an overview of the default
   options files. For the \cb{pkg-test} command the search start
   directory is the configuration directory. The following options files are
   searched for in each directory and, if found, loaded in the order listed:

   \
   bpkg.options
   bpkg-pkg-test.options
   \

   The following \cb{pkg-test} command options cannot be specified in the
   default options files:

   \
   --directory|-d
   \
  "
