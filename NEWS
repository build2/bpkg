Version 0.13.0

  * The SPDX License Expression is now the default scheme for the 'license'
    package manifest value.

    See the "license" section in the manual for details.

  * New --pkg-proxy common option.

    This option specifies the proxy server to use when fetching package
    manifests and archives from remote pkg repositories. See the option
    documentation in bpkg-common(1) for details.

  * External test packages can now have their own build constraints.

Version 0.12.0

  * Ability to specify the full package version constraint in the pkg-build
    command.

    For example:

    $ bpkg build "bar < 2.0.0"

    See bpkg-pkg-build(1) for details.

  * Support for default options files (aka tool config files).

    See the bpkg-default-options-files(1) help topic for background and the
    DEFAULT OPTIONS FILES section in each command's man pages for specifics.

  * Support for tests, examples, and benchmarks as separate packages.

    See the "tests, examples, benchmarks" section in the manual for details.

Version 0.11.0

  * The 'tags' package manifest value has been deprecated and replaced with
    'keywords' (list of space-separated words) and 'topics' (list of comma-
    separated, potentially multi-word concepts). For example:

    topics: xml parser, xml serializer
    keywords: sax dom

  * New 'description-type' package manifest value allows specifying the
    content type of the 'description' or 'description-file' value. Currently
    recognized values are:

    text/plain
    text/markdown
    text/markdown;variant=GFM
    text/markdown;variant=CommonMark

  * New 'upstream-version' package manifest value allows preserving the
    original version for information.

  * The pkg-build command can now "build" a system package that doesn't have a
    stub provided its version is specified explicitly. For example:

    $ bpkg build ... ?sys:libsqlite3/* ?sys:libcurl/7.47.0

  * New cfg-create --existing|-e option allows initializing a bpkg
    configuration based on an existing build system configuration instead of
    creating a new one from scratch. For example:

    $ b create: build-clang/,cc config.cxx=clang++
    $ bpkg create -d build-clang --existing

  * New rep-info --deep option triggers the replacement of '*-file' package
    manifest values with the contents of the referenced files.

Version 0.10.0

  * Only minor improvements and bug fixes.

Version 0.9.0

  * Support for the ssh:// protocol in the git repository URLs.

  * The repository type can now be specified in the repository URL's scheme
    component. For example:

    $ bpkg build git+https://example.org/project

  * New 'builds' package manifest value for specifying the build configuration
    classes the package should or should not be built for. For example:

    builds: -windows

    Note also that the 'build-include' and 'build-exclude' pattern matching
    semantics has been adjusted to distinguish between single-component ('*')
    and multi-component ('**') matches. See the manual for details.

  * Support for the '$' dependent package's version special value in the
    package manifest dependency constraints.

    This mechanism is primarily useful when developing related packages that
    should track each other's versions exactly or closely. For example:

    name: sqlite3
    version: 3.18.2
    depends: libsqlite3 == $

    See the 'depends' package manifest value in the manual for details.

  * Support for passing configuration variables in the bpkg-pkg-build command.

  * New 'build-warning-email' and 'build-error-email' package manifest values
    for specifying alternative emails for different diagnostics levels. See
    the manual for details.

  * New --jobs|-j option for specifying the number of jobs to perform in
    parallel.

  * New --no-progress option for suppressing progress indicators.

  * New --deep option for the bpkg-pkg-verify command. See the command's man
    pages for details.

  * Values to the --openssl* options can now be qualified with the command
    they should apply to.

Version 0.8.0

  * New optional 'project' manifest value that specifies the project the
    package belongs to. See the manual for details.

  * Make package manifest 'url' and 'email' values optional.

  * Make default versioning epoch 1 instead of 0 (0 is now reserved for
    "foreign" packages).

  * New --manifest option for the pkg-verify command that allows extracting
    package's manifest file.

  * New --{repositories|packages}-file options for the rep-info command.

    This allows saving both manifests with a single invocation (which is the
    only way to guarantee they are consistent).

Version 0.7.0

  * Support for using git repositories as package repositories. See the
    bpkg-repository-types(1) help topic for details (structure, URL format).

  * Support for ~ and ^ version constraint operators. See the 'depends'
    package manifest value documentation in the manual for details.

  * The pkg-build command has been significantly reworked. In particular, it
    allows "building" repositories in addition to packages (primarily useful
    with version control-based repositories) and upgrading (--upgrade|-u) or
    patching (--patch|-p) immediate (--immediate|-i) or all (--recursive|-r)
    dependencies of a package. See bpkg-pkg-build(1) for details.

  * The pkg-status has been significantly reworked. In particular, it allows
    querying the status of immediate (--immediate|-i) or all (--recursive|-r)
    dependencies of a package. See bpkg-pkg-status(1) for details.

  * New commands: rep-list, rep-remove, and pkg-checkout. See their respective
    man pages for details.

  * The pkg-{test,install,uninstall} commands now also support --immediate|-i
    and --recursive|-r options (testing/installation of dependencies).

  * The pkg-{update,clean,test,install,uninstall} commands now support the
    --all|-a option.

  * The rep-fetch command now supports shallow fetching and fetching only a
    specific repository. See bpkg-rep-fetch(1) for details.

  * New --for|-f <operation> option to the pkg-update and pkg-build commands.

    This allows executing build2 *-for-X operations (e.g., update-for-install
    or update-for-test) in order to minimize the amount of stuff to be
    updated.

  * New --fetch-timeout common option.

  * The repositories, packages, and signature files now use the .manifest
    extension.

Version 0.6.0

  * Add doc-url and src-url manifest values.

  * Support for repository certificate wildcards.

    A wildcard in the *.example.com form matches any single-level subdomain
    while **.example.com -- any subdomains. See the bpkg-repository-signing(1)
    help topic for details.

Version 0.5.0

  * Multiple usability fixes and improvements.

  * The test suite has been rewritten in Testscript and can now be used on all
    supported platforms.

Version 0.4.0

  * Support for repository signing and authentication.

    The rep-create command can now sign the repository with rep-fetch(fetch)
    and rep-info authenticating it. See the bpkg-repository-signing(1) help
    topic for details.

  * Support for system packages.

    Now a package can be "built" as available from the system rather than
    compiling it from source. To specify a system package the new sys: package
    scheme is used, for example:

    bpkg build sys:libsqlite3

    Currently, if no version is specified for a system package, then it is
    considered to be unknown but satisfying any dependency constraint (such a
    wildcard version is displayed as '*'). In the future bpkg will support
    querying system package managers (rpm, dpkg, pkg-config) for the installed
    version.

    See the pkg-build(build) man page for details.

  * Support for stub packages.

    A stub is a package without source code. It has the special upstream
    version 0 (with a possible revision, for example 0+1) and can only be
    built as a system package.

  * Support for build-time dependencies.

    Now a depends: value in the package manifest that starts with '*' is
    recognized as a built-time dependency.  Currently, build-time dependencies
    are treated in the same way as normal (run-time) ones except that the
    'build2' and 'bpkg' names are recognized as special. They can be used to
    specify a constraint (usually the required minimum version) on the build2
    build system and package manager, respectively. In the future, the
    semantics for build-time dependencies will be extended, for example, to
    verify that they can be executed on the build machine and/or to build them
    in a separate configuration in case of cross-compilation.

  * The pkg-build(build) command now offers to automatically update dependent
    packages that were reconfigured.

    It also supports the following new options:

    --drop-prerequisite|-D
    --update-dependent|-U
    --leave-dependent|-L

     As well as the -K alias for --keep-prerequisite. See the command's man
     page for details.

  * The pkg-drop(drop) command now supports the following new options:

    --keep-dependent|-K,
    --drop-prerequisite|-D
    --keep-prerequisite

    See the command's man page for details.

  * The cfg-add command was renamed to rep-add (the add alias stays the same)
    and cfg-fetch to rep-fetch (the fetch alias stays the same).

  * The new -V option is an alias for --verbose 3 (show all commands).

Version 0.3.0

  * Command line options and arguments can now be specified in any order. This
    is especially useful if you want to re-run the previous command with -v:

    bpkg update libfoo -v

  * The pkg-build command now offers to drop prerequisite packages that are no
    longer necessary. This can happen if a package that is being upgraded or
    downgraded changes its prerequisite set. You can use the
    --keep-prerequisite option to suppress this behavior.

  * The pkg-build command now updates all packages at once (that is, with a
    single build system invocation) instead of sequentially one at a time.
    This should improve performance, especially once parallelism is supported.

  * The rep-create command now loads the description-file and changes-file
    files from the package archives and includes their contents inline into
    the 'packages' manifest file.

Version 0.2.1

  * The pkg-build command no longer considers an argument as a potential
    package directory unless it ends with a directory separator.

Version 0.2.0

  * First public release.
