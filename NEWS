Version 0.4.0

  * Rename the cfg-add command to rep-add (the add alias stays the same) and
    cfg-fetch to rep-fetch (the fetch alias stays the same).

  * The pkg-build command now offers to automatically update dependent
    packages that were reconfigured.

    It also supports the following new options: --drop-prerequisite|-D,
    --update-dependent|-U, --leave-dependent|-L, as well as the -K alias for
    --keep-prerequisite. See the command's man page for details.

  * The pkg-drop command now supports the following new options:
    --keep-dependent|-K, --drop-prerequisite|-D, and --keep-prerequisite. See
    the command's man page for details.

  * Add support for repository authentication. The rep-create command can now
    sign the repository, and rep-fetch and rep-info commands can authenticate
    the repository being fetched.

Version 0.3.0

  * Command line options and arguments can now be specified in any order. This
    is especially useful if you want to re-run the previous command with -v:

    bpkg update libfoo -v

  * The pkg-build command now offers to drop prerequisite packages that are no
    longer necessary. This can happen if a package that is being upgraded or
    downgraded changes its prerequisite set. You can use the
    --keep-prerequisite option to suppress this behavior.

  * The pkg-build command now updates all packages at once (that is, with a
    single build system invocation) instead of sequentially one at a time.
    This should improve performance, especially once parallelism is supported.

  * The rep-create command now loads the description-file and changes-file
    files from the package archives and includes their contents inline into
    the 'packages' manifest file.

Version 0.2.1

  * The pkg-build command no longer considers an argument as a potential
    package directory unless it ends with a directory separator.

Version 0.2.0

  * First public release.
