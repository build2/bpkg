Version 0.3.0

  * Command line options and arguments can now be specified in any order. This
    is especially useful if you want to re-run the previous command with -v:

    bpkg update libfoo -v

  * The pkg-build command now offers to drop prerequisite packages that are no
    longer necessary. This can happen if a package that is being upgraded or
    downgraded changes its prerequisite set. You can use the
    --keep-prerequisite option to suppress this behavior.

  * The pkg-build command now updates all packages at once (that is, with a
    single build system invocation) instead of sequentially one at a time.
    This should improve performance, especially once parallelism is supported.

  * The rep-create command now loads the description-file and changes-file
    files from the package archives and includes their contents inline into
    the 'packages' manifest file.

Version 0.2.0

  * First public release.
