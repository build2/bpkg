# Create an empty configuration that will be copied by subsequent tests and
# scopes setup commands. The common approach will be that group scopes copy and
# modify the parent scope configuration as required by the nested tests and
# scopes. Tests will also clone the parent scope configuration to optionally
# modify it, use and cleanup at the end. Note that configuration can not be
# shared between multiple bpkg processes. Also we need to make sure that
# configurations are not cloned while being used by bpkg.
