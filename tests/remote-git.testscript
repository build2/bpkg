# Tests for commands that accept git repository location must be able to run
# regardless whether the repository is local or remote. They also must be able
# to create the repository used for testing at the specified path, so being
# published to build2.org it can be used for the remote testing. Note that
# prior to publishing repositories tests must be performed with the
# config.test.output=keep variable override, so their working directories (that
# contain repositories produced) are not cleaned up.
#

# Check that git version is the minimum supported one (2.14.0) or above (see
# bpkg/fetch-git.cxx for details).

# later fails for dangling symlinks and we have such symlinks in the
