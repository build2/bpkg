# Tests for commands that accept repository location must be able to run
# regardless whether the repository is local or remote. They also must be able
# to create the repository used for testing at the specified path, so being
# published to build2.org it can be used for the remote testing. Note that
# prior to publishing repositories tests must be performed with the
# config.test.output=keep variable override, so their working directories (that
# contain repositories produced) are not cleaned up.
#

# Output directory path that testscripts must use to prepare repositories
# required by tests they contains.
#
# Note that the local path is carefully crafted so that we end up with the
# same repository names in both (local and remote) cases. This is necessary
# for the authentication to work properly in both cases.

out = $canonicalize([dir_path] $~/pkg/1/build2.org/)

# If $remote is true then remote repositories locations must be used for
# tests. Variables rep_root and rep refer to the root and the command-
# specific repositories respectively. Note that the variables type is dir_path
# for local repositories (rather than string for the remote ones), that allows
# to portably obtain sub-repositories locations representations.
